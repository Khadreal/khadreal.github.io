I have painted this scenario so many times in my mind…

It’s the year 2050, and Cortana has just sorted out my breakfast. She has also sent a message to my self-driving Lamborghini, making it warm up in time for a ride to the office.

While in the car, Jarvis gives me my daily update of news events around the world; the highlight, Arsenal’s latest feat at the Champion’s league.
I got to the office and send all the errands to the office A.I with it a timeline which it will sort out before close of business.

From virtual assistants to sex robots like Samantha, human beings are slowly being replaced in interactions by robots. And it’s not even in 2050. As much as I clamour for the future, I’m also scared of it. As Bill Gates once warned, computers have indeed become our silicon masters, pervading nearly every aspect of our modern lives.

Alternatively, something else I think about is how fast parts of the world are moving in the tech industry. It isn’t only alarmingly fast but also makes our confidence in techy knowledge always shaky since what is in vogue today might become obsolete tomorrow, literally. This brings me to the question, “Are we ready to make these advancements in our corner of the world, or would we simply play catch up as usual?”.

According to Steve Jobs, "Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.” I personally think it is time we add programming as core subject or course in our institutions. Predicting the future is best done by creating and the future (leaders) of tomorrow are the kids today.

Once again, are we ready for the future?
